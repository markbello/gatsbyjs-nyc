# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Branch off/PR into `develop` when making changes. This allows us to test changes locally before
releasing into `master`. Be sure to `git pull` from develop *before* branching to make sure your version
is current, in order to avoid any possible merge conflicts
2. Commit messages follow the pattern of `type(scope): subject` in less than 72 characters. For instance
`feat(CONTRIBUTING): add guidelines`
3. Limit the scope of changes to include only one "thing" per pull request
4. When ready to merge into `develop`, we will ask you to squash your changes into a single commit
5. We will release `develop` into `master` with a version bump after validating changes
6. We will then merge `master` back into `develop`
7. ...
8. PROFIT
